Accordions for this site are generated with the
[Accordion Blocks plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/accordion-blocks/).
This demo simulates the markup generated by that plugin, but it does not
include the interactive functionality and is not suitable for reuse outside of
that plugin.

<Canvas>
<Story name='Accordion'>
  {
        () => {
            const accordion = (
                <AccordionComponent></AccordionComponent>
            );
            return <RawHTML component={accordion}></RawHTML>
        }
  }
</Story>
</Canvas>
